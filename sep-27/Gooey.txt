In American Artist's well formed essay Black Gooey Universe
we are introduced in the racial problems in the creations of the 
GUI or (gooey).
Where things such as whitespace and the gui interface is presented as 
a white man's construct. Which it is. 

The most technologies that we today take forgiven was created
by white men. But so has the black command line screen that the first 
computers that had a screen were interacted through. As well as the morden 
GUI was made by mostly if not only by  white men. 

I am having a hard time to undertstand how that the transformation from a black
terminal to a GUI withspace is a manifistation of the white mans position in the 
tech world? Would a GUI developed by a raceial neutral team be something else than 
what we a used to today? 

I belive what American want to say with his essay is that the tech industry 
is far from free of rasisim and it isn't. The tech industry is still dominated 
by the white man which isn't good. But I think as well that some of the
constructs haven't been made with a underlying rassism but more from convingence.
